<objective>
Human verification checkpoint for all manual testing requirements that cannot be automated.

Purpose: TEST-02 (physical device), TEST-03 (task completion time), and TEST-05 (actual monitor) require real human interaction. TEST-01 and TEST-04 automated tests need their results reviewed. This plan gates phase completion on human verification.
Output: Verification that all testing requirements are met.

  <name>Task 1: Cross-browser and manual testing verification</name>
  <action>
This is a human verification checkpoint. Claude presents the automated test results and guides the user through manual testing steps.

What was built in Plans 01-03:
- Unit tests for all primitive components (Button, Card, Badge, CollectionCard, ProtectedRoute, AuthContext)
- Lighthouse CI config with performance budgets (>90 score, LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1)
- Bundle size monitoring (CSS <50KB gzipped)
- Playwright E2E tests for cross-browser visual regression, responsive layouts, and accessibility
- Multi-locale visual regression tests (EN/LT/RU)

Run automated tests first to present results:
1. `cd frontend && npx vitest run` — run all unit tests
2. `cd frontend && npm run build && node scripts/check-bundle-size.js` — run bundle size check
3. Present results to user and guide them through manual steps below.
  </action>
  <verify>
**TEST-01: Cross-browser testing**
1. Run Playwright E2E tests: `cd frontend && npx playwright test`
2. Review HTML report: `cd frontend && npx playwright show-report`
3. Verify all 5 projects pass (Chrome, Firefox, Safari desktop + Chrome, Safari mobile)
4. Manually check pixelforge.pro in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers — verify navigation, forms, and photo grids render correctly

**TEST-02: Physical device testing**
5. Open pixelforge.pro on an iOS device (iPhone)
6. Open pixelforge.pro on an Android device
7. Verify: bottom navigation touch targets are easy to tap with one hand
8. Verify: buttons and links have comfortable tap areas (48px+)
9. Verify: photo grid scrolls smoothly, images load correctly
10. Verify: forms (login, create collection) are usable with on-screen keyboard

**TEST-03: Task completion time**
11. On current production, time these flows:
    - Create a new collection (from /collections page to collection created)
    - Upload 3 photos to a collection
    - Share a collection with a client (from collection page to share link visible)
12. Record times. These are baseline numbers for v3.0 comparison.

**TEST-04: Multi-locale visual regression**
13. Run: `cd frontend && npx playwright test e2e/visual-regression/`
14. First run creates baseline screenshots. Review them manually for:
    - No text overflow or truncation in LT or RU locales
    - Buttons have adequate width for longer translations
    - Navigation items fit without wrapping

**TEST-05: Desktop monitor testing**
15. Open pixelforge.pro on a 1920x1080 monitor — verify content fills space appropriately, no excessive whitespace
16. If available, open on 2560x1440 monitor — verify content is bounded by max-width containers, no ultra-wide sprawl

**QUALITY-01 through QUALITY-04:**
17. Run: `cd frontend && npm run build && node scripts/check-bundle-size.js` — verify CSS <50KB gzipped
18. Optionally run Lighthouse: `lhci autorun --config=lighthouserc.json` (requires global @lhci/cli)

Type "approved" with any notes on test results, or describe issues found that need fixing.
  </verify>
  <done>Human has verified all 5 TEST requirements (TEST-01 through TEST-05) and all 4 QUALITY requirements (QUALITY-01 through QUALITY-04). Phase 16 Testing and QA is complete.</done>

All manual testing requirements verified by human:
- TEST-01: Cross-browser testing complete
- TEST-02: Physical device testing confirms touch targets and one-handed use
- TEST-03: Task completion times recorded as baseline
- TEST-04: Multi-locale screenshots reviewed for overflow
- TEST-05: Desktop monitors tested for content dispersion
- QUALITY-01: CSS bundle <50KB gzipped confirmed
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Human has verified all 5 TEST requirements and all 4 QUALITY requirements
- Any issues found are either fixed or documented for future iteration
- Phase 16 can be marked complete
</success_criteria>
