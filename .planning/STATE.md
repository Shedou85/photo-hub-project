# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-11)

**Core value:** The photographer can hand a client a link — the client selects photos for editing, the photographer delivers finals — without the client ever needing an account.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Local file storage (backend/uploads/) — simplest path to ship; cloud migration planned but not needed now
- Token-based client access (no accounts) — friction-free for clients; photographers share one link
- Server-side ZIP generation (PHP) — deferred to v2; not in current milestone scope

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Verify GD WebP support on Hostinger with `gd_info()` before committing to WebP thumbnail output
- Phase 1: Confirm `backend/uploads/` directory access control (.htaccess deny) before any photos reach production
- Phase 4 (post): ZIP delivery (DELIV-02 through DELIV-04) is v2 — verify Hostinger `max_execution_time` before planning that milestone
