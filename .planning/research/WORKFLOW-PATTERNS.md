# Workflow Patterns Research

**Domain:** Photographer workspace workflow and state-based UI patterns
**Researched:** 2026-02-14
**Confidence:** MEDIUM (based on WebSearch + industry pattern analysis)

## Research Context

This research focuses on how top photographer platforms (PhotoShelter, Pic-Time, ShootProof, Pixieset) organize their **photographer workspace** and guide users through workflow phases. Specifically investigating:

- State-based conditional UI (what shows in DRAFT vs SELECTING vs REVIEWING vs DELIVERED)
- Auto-navigation patterns after actions (e.g., after creating collection, after upload)
- Progressive disclosure patterns (when to hide/show upload zones, action buttons)
- Workflow guidance patterns (how to make "next step" obvious)
- Action organization patterns (primary vs secondary button hierarchy)

**Current Photo Hub issues being addressed:**
- "Start client selection" button shows with 0 photos (wrong)
- After creating collection, user stays on list page (should auto-navigate)
- Upload dropzone doesn't adapt to collection state
- Workflow phases not visually clear

## Key Findings: Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: State-Based Progressive Disclosure

**What:** UI elements appear/disappear based on collection state and photo count.

**Industry Standard:**
- **Empty collection (0 photos):** Large upload dropzone is primary UI. No workflow actions available. Message: "Upload photos to get started."
- **Collection with photos (1+ photos):** Upload zone collapses to small "Add more photos" button. Workflow actions become visible.
- **After client selection submitted:** Selection-phase actions disabled. Review/editing actions become primary.
- **After finals uploaded:** Delivery actions enabled. Upload/selection actions de-emphasized.

**Pixieset implementation (observed):**
- Dashboard shows "+ Add Files" button or drag-and-drop zone
- After upload starts, can "keep working in the dashboard without interruption"
- Upload zone adapts from full-screen to toolbar button after first photo

**Pic-Time implementation (observed):**
- "Workflow tab" in gallery shows contextual actions based on current state
- Selection requests only available when gallery has photos
- Client selection interface adapts based on photographer's specified selection count

**ShootProof implementation (observed):**
- Gallery settings available immediately, but "Client can favorite" toggle requires photos
- Proofing features activate only after photos exist
- Download permissions are state-dependent (photographer controls when enabled)

**Complexity:** LOW
**Dependencies:**
- Requires `collection.photoCount` check
- Requires `collection.status` enum

---

### Pattern 2: Auto-Navigation After Actions

**What:** Automatically redirect user to relevant view after completing an action.

**Industry Standard:**
- **After creating collection:** Navigate to collection details page (NOT back to list)
- **After upload completes:** Stay on collection details (show success message)
- **After client submits selection:** Photographer dashboard redirects to review view
- **After generating delivery link:** Navigate to delivery link preview page

**Why this pattern:**
- Reduces clicks (user's next action is almost always "configure this collection")
- Provides immediate feedback (user sees the thing they just created)
- Guides workflow (suggests logical next step)

**Pixieset guidance (from research):**
"After registering for an account, you'll be guided through creating your first photo gallery and exploring all its features."

**Pic-Time workflow:**
- After requesting client selection, photographer receives email notification when complete
- Lightroom plugin integration syncs selected photos back, auto-navigating to selection view

**Photo studio workflows (general pattern):**
- Project boards with drag-and-drop between stages (Inquiry → Booking → Session Planning → Gallery Delivery)
- Moving project card between stages auto-navigates to stage detail view

**Complexity:** LOW
**Dependencies:**
- React Router programmatic navigation (`useNavigate()`)
- Action completion callback hooks

**Anti-pattern to avoid:**
- Creating collection → staying on list page → forcing user to find and click new collection
- This creates "where did it go?" confusion and extra clicks

---

### Pattern 3: Contextual Action Hierarchy

**What:** Primary vs secondary button styling based on collection state.

**Industry Standard (2026 UI best practices):**

**Primary button (most important action):**
- Visual prominence (filled background, high contrast)
- One per screen/section
- Changes based on state:
  - DRAFT (0 photos): "Upload Photos"
  - DRAFT (1+ photos): "Share with Client"
  - SELECTING: "View Client Selections"
  - REVIEWING: "Upload Finals"
  - DELIVERED: "Copy Delivery Link"

**Secondary buttons (supporting actions):**
- Less prominent (outline/ghost style)
- Multiple allowed
- Always available but de-emphasized:
  - "Edit Details"
  - "Add More Photos"
  - "Archive Collection"

**Tertiary actions (low priority):**
- Text-only links or icon buttons
- "Delete Collection"
- "Download Originals"

**From UI design research (2026):**
- "Use one primary button per display in a workflow. Primary buttons signify the most important action a user should take."
- "Secondary button executes an action that is less important than the primary button but still relevant to the user's workflow."
- "Visual hierarchy directs the eye to the most important elements of a design."

**Complexity:** LOW
**Dependencies:**
- Tailwind button component variants (already exist in Photo Hub)
- State-based conditional rendering

---

### Pattern 4: Empty State Guidance

**What:** Show helpful messaging and CTAs when collection has no content.

**Industry Best Practices (2026):**

**Elements of good empty state:**
1. **Clear explanation:** "You haven't uploaded any photos yet."
2. **Visual context:** Icon or illustration (camera, upload cloud)
3. **Single clear CTA:** "Upload Photos" button
4. **Optional help text:** "Drag and drop photos here or click to browse."

**Photographer platform patterns:**
- Empty collection shows large upload dropzone with guidance
- Empty selection state (client view): "Your photographer hasn't shared any photos yet."
- Empty finals state: "Waiting for photographer to upload edited photos."

**From empty state UX research:**
- "Each design typically follows a relevant icon, a short message, and a single call-to-action."
- "Use empty states to provide help cues by telling users what could be displayed and how to populate the area with content."
- "Clear explanation and purpose are essential — for example, in a task management tool you might say 'You haven't added any tasks yet. Get started by clicking the + New Task button.'"

**Photo Hub application:**
- Collection details (0 photos): Show large upload zone + "Upload photos to start your collection"
- Selection view (client, 0 selections): "You haven't selected any photos yet. Click hearts to mark your favorites."
- Delivery view (0 finals): "Your photographer is preparing your final photos. Check back soon!"

**Complexity:** LOW
**Dependencies:** Photo count check, status check

---

### Pattern 5: Workflow Phase Visualization

**What:** Make current workflow stage visually obvious.

**Industry Patterns:**

**Progress indicators:**
- Linear steps (1. Upload → 2. Share → 3. Review → 4. Deliver)
- Current step highlighted
- Completed steps checked
- Future steps grayed out

**Status badges:**
- Color-coded collection states (already in Photo Hub)
- DRAFT = gray/neutral
- SELECTING = blue
- REVIEWING = yellow/orange
- DELIVERED = green
- DOWNLOADED = purple

**Project board approach:**
- Kanban-style columns for each workflow stage
- Collections as cards dragged between columns
- Visual count of collections in each stage

**Pic-Time approach:**
- "Workflow tab" in each gallery
- Shows available actions for current stage
- Completed stages collapsed, current stage expanded

**From research:**
- "By redesigning workflows to surface 'next best actions,' simplifying data-heavy screens, and using adaptive UI logic, significant improvements in task completion were achieved."
- "Contextual help is implemented through various UX patterns such as tooltips, inline help, guided tours, interactive walkthroughs."

**Photo Hub recommendation:**
- Keep existing status badges (already good)
- Add "Next step" guidance text in collection details header
  - DRAFT (0 photos): "Upload photos to get started"
  - DRAFT (1+ photos): "Share link with client to start selection"
  - SELECTING: "Waiting for client selections"
  - REVIEWING: "Upload edited finals to complete delivery"
  - DELIVERED: "Share delivery link with client"
  - DOWNLOADED: "Collection complete!"

**Complexity:** LOW
**Dependencies:** Status enum, conditional text rendering

---

### Pattern 6: Conditional Button Enablement

**What:** Disable/hide buttons until prerequisites are met.

**Industry Standard:**

**Disable vs Hide:**
- **Disable (grayed out):** When action will be available later (e.g., "Start Selection" disabled until photos exist)
- **Hide completely:** When action is not relevant to current state (e.g., "Upload Finals" hidden during DRAFT)

**Photo Hub specific cases:**

| Button | State | Condition | Pattern |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| "Start Client Selection" | DRAFT | `photoCount === 0` | **HIDE** (not relevant yet) |
| "Start Client Selection" | DRAFT | `photoCount > 0` | **SHOW** (prerequisite met) |
| "Copy Selection Link" | SELECTING | Always | **SHOW** (active workflow) |
| "View Selections" | SELECTING | `selectionCount === 0` | **DISABLE** (nothing to view yet) |
| "View Selections" | SELECTING | `selectionCount > 0` | **ENABLE** (has content) |
| "Upload Finals" | REVIEWING | Always | **SHOW** (primary action) |
| "Copy Delivery Link" | DELIVERED | Always | **SHOW** (primary action) |
| "Upload Photos" | All states | Always | **SHOW** as secondary (can always add more) |

**From research (anti-patterns to avoid):**
- Showing "Start client selection" with 0 photos creates confusion ("Why can't I click this?")
- Better to hide entirely until photos exist
- Alternative: Show with tooltip explaining prerequisite

**Complexity:** LOW
**Dependencies:** State checks, photo count checks

---

### Pattern 7: Upload Zone Adaptation

**What:** Upload interface changes based on collection photo count.

**Pixieset pattern (observed):**
- New collection: Full-screen drag-and-drop zone with large icon and text
- After upload: Compact "+ Add Files" button in toolbar
- Drag-and-drop still works in photo grid area
- "Redesigned uploader you can keep working in the dashboard without interruption"

**General SaaS pattern:**
- Empty state: Large, prominent upload CTA (primary action)
- With content: Compact "Add more" button (secondary action)
- Maintains drag-and-drop on grid for convenience

**Photo Hub implementation:**
```javascript
// Simplified logic
if (collection.photoCount === 0) {
  return <LargeUploadDropzone />
} else {
  return (
    <>
      <PhotoGrid enableDragDrop={true} />
      <CompactAddMoreButton />
    </>
  )
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces visual clutter once photos exist
- Keeps upload accessible but not dominating
- Grid becomes primary focus (the content)

**Complexity:** LOW
**Dependencies:** Photo count check, conditional component rendering

---

### Pattern 8: Next-Step Guidance

**What:** Explicitly tell user what to do next.

**From UX research:**
- "Guided tour is an interactive onboarding flow that walks users through an app step by step, providing clear instructions, highlighting key actions, and minimizing friction."
- "By redesigning workflows to surface 'next best actions,' simplifying data-heavy screens, and using adaptive UI logic, significant improvements in task completion were achieved."

**Photographer platform examples:**

**Pic-Time:**
- "Workflow tab" shows current stage actions
- Email notifications guide photographer to next step
- "After requesting client selection, photographer receives email notification when complete"

**Pixieset:**
- "After registering for an account, you'll be guided through creating your first photo gallery and exploring all its features."
- Dashboard surfaces next actions contextually

**Implementation patterns:**

**1. Inline guidance text:**
```
DRAFT (0 photos): "Upload photos to create your collection"
DRAFT (1+ photos): "Ready to share! Copy the link below to send to your client"
SELECTING: "Your client is selecting photos. You'll be notified when complete."
REVIEWING: "Client selected X photos. Upload edited finals to complete delivery."
DELIVERED: "Finals ready! Share the delivery link below with your client."
```

**2. Action prompts:**
- Highlight primary button with pulsing outline or badge
- Show "1 action required" indicator on collection cards
- Dashboard filter: "Collections needing action"

**3. Contextual help:**
- Tooltip on hover: explains what button does
- Help icon (?) next to unfamiliar actions
- Inline expandable help text

**Complexity:** LOW (text), MEDIUM (interactive prompts)
**Dependencies:** Status checks, i18n for text

## Table Stakes vs Differentiators

### Table Stakes (Photographer Workspace)

Features users expect. Missing these = product feels incomplete.

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Collection list view | Standard dashboard pattern | LOW | Already exists in Photo Hub |
| Status-based filtering | Photographers manage 20-50 collections; must filter | LOW | Extend existing status badges |
| Auto-navigate after create | Standard UX; reduces clicks | LOW | React Router programmatic navigation |
| Upload zone adaptation | Industry standard (Pixieset, others do this) | LOW | Conditional rendering based on photo count |
| Primary action prominence | UI best practice 2026 | LOW | Button hierarchy via Tailwind variants |
| Empty state guidance | UX best practice 2026 | LOW | Conditional text + icon |
| Conditional button display | Prevents confusion (e.g., "Start selection" with 0 photos) | LOW | Hide/show based on prerequisites |

### Differentiators (Competitive Advantage)

Features that set the product apart. Not required, but valuable.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Explicit status lifecycle visualization | Photo Hub's DRAFT → SELECTING → REVIEWING → DELIVERED → DOWNLOADED is clearer than competitors' implicit states | LOW | Already implemented; just needs UI polish |
| Integrated selection → delivery flow | Single link adapts vs competitors requiring separate links | LOW | Already planned in v2.0 |
| Next-step guidance text | Few competitors explicitly tell photographer "what to do next" | LOW | Simple conditional text rendering |
| Progressive button disclosure | Most platforms show all buttons always; adaptive UX reduces cognitive load | LOW | State-based conditional rendering |
| One-click collection archiving | Many platforms require multi-step archive workflow | MEDIUM | Future enhancement |

### Anti-Features (Commonly Requested, Often Problematic)

Features that seem good but create problems.

| Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Kanban board for collections | "I want to drag collections between workflow stages" | Adds complexity for marginal value; filtering by status achieves same goal | Status-based filtering + visual badges |
| Real-time workflow notifications | "Notify me instantly when client submits selections" | WebSocket overhead; photographer workflow is async (hours between checks) | Email digest; manual dashboard refresh |
| Workflow templates / presets | "I want to save collection settings as templates" | Premature optimization; defer until photographers request it | Start with sane defaults; add templates in v3+ |
| Multi-step wizard for collection creation | "Guide photographer through every option" | Friction; experienced users resent forced steps | Simple create → auto-navigate → configure |
| In-app tutorial overlays | "Show tooltips explaining every feature" | Annoying for repeat users; hard to maintain | Contextual help icons; optional guided tour on first login (defer to v3+) |

## Workflow State Transitions

### Photo Hub Lifecycle

```
[DRAFT]
  ├─ No photos: Show large upload zone, hide workflow actions
  └─ Has photos: Collapse upload, show "Share with Client" as primary action
       ↓ (photographer shares link)
[SELECTING]
  ├─ Client can select photos
  ├─ Photographer sees "Waiting for selections" message
  └─ Downloads blocked
       ↓ (client submits selections)
[REVIEWING]
  ├─ Photographer can view selected photos
  ├─ "Upload Finals" becomes primary action
  └─ Downloads still blocked
       ↓ (photographer uploads finals, transitions to DELIVERED)
[DELIVERED]
  ├─ Delivery link auto-generated
  ├─ "Copy Delivery Link" becomes primary action
  ├─ Selection link redirects to delivery page
  └─ Downloads enabled
       ↓ (client downloads ZIP or photos)
[DOWNLOADED]
  ├─ Collection marked complete
  ├─ "Download confirmed" badge shown
  └─ All actions available (re-download, archive)
```

### UI Changes at Each Transition

| Transition | UI Change | Primary Action | Secondary Actions |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Create → DRAFT (0 photos) | Large upload dropzone | "Upload Photos" | "Edit Details", "Delete" |
| Upload → DRAFT (1+ photos) | Collapse upload zone | "Share with Client" | "Add More Photos", "Edit Details" |
| Share → SELECTING | Status badge blue | "Copy Selection Link" | "View Selections" (disabled until client selects) |
| Client selects → REVIEWING | Status badge yellow | "Upload Finals" | "View Selections", "Add More Photos" |
| Upload finals → DELIVERED | Status badge green, delivery link appears | "Copy Delivery Link" | "View Finals", "Download ZIP" |
| Client downloads → DOWNLOADED | Status badge purple | "View Downloads" | "Archive Collection" |

## Action Organization Patterns

### Current Photo Hub Issues

**Problem 1: "Start client selection" shows with 0 photos**
- **Fix:** Hide button completely until `photoCount > 0`
- **Alternative:** Disable with tooltip "Upload photos first"
- **Recommendation:** Hide (cleaner UX)

**Problem 2: After creating collection, user stays on list page**
- **Fix:** `navigate(\`/collection/${newCollectionId}\`)` after create success
- **Benefit:** Immediate context + suggests next step (upload photos)

**Problem 3: Upload dropzone doesn't adapt to collection state**
- **Fix:** Conditional rendering:
  ```javascript
  {photoCount === 0 ? <LargeDropzone /> : <CompactAddButton />}
  ```

**Problem 4: Workflow phases not visually clear**
- **Fix:** Add "Next step" guidance text below status badge
- **Example:** REVIEWING: "Upload edited finals to complete delivery"

### Dependency Notes

- **Photo count is cross-cutting:** Used for empty states, upload zone rendering, button enablement
- **Status enum gates most UI decisions:** Primary action, guidance text, button visibility all depend on status
- **Auto-navigation enhances onboarding:** Reduces friction for new users; experienced users learn pattern quickly
- **Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load:** Hide complexity until relevant; surfacing all actions always creates decision paralysis

## Implementation Complexity Assessment

| Pattern | Complexity | Effort | Priority |
|---------|------------|--------|----------|
| Upload zone adaptation | LOW | 1-2 hours | P1 (high value, low cost) |
| Conditional button display | LOW | 2-3 hours | P1 (fixes current bug) |
| Auto-navigate after create | LOW | 1 hour | P1 (standard UX) |
| Empty state guidance | LOW | 1-2 hours | P1 (UX best practice) |
| Primary action hierarchy | LOW | 2-3 hours | P1 (visual clarity) |
| Next-step guidance text | LOW | 2-4 hours | P2 (nice polish) |
| Status-based filtering (dashboard) | LOW | 3-4 hours | P2 (scaling feature) |
| Workflow phase visualization | MEDIUM | 4-6 hours | P3 (future enhancement) |

**Priority key:**
- P1: Must have (fixes current issues + industry standard patterns)
- P2: Should have (improves UX, moderate value)
- P3: Nice to have (future enhancement, lower ROI)

**Total P1 effort estimate:** 8-12 hours (can ship in single phase)

## Competitor Workflow Comparison

| Pattern | Pixieset | Pic-Time | ShootProof | Photo Hub (Current) | Photo Hub (Recommended) |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Upload zone adaptation | YES (compact after upload) | Not observed | Not observed | NO (always large) | **FIX: YES** |
| Auto-navigate after create | YES (guided workflow) | YES (workflow tab) | Not observed | NO (stays on list) | **FIX: YES** |
| Conditional button display | YES (state-aware) | YES (workflow tab) | YES (state-aware) | PARTIAL (status badge only) | **FIX: YES** |
| Empty state guidance | YES (clear messaging) | YES (workflow prompts) | YES (setup guidance) | NO (blank dropzone) | **FIX: YES** |
| Status visualization | IMPLICIT (no labels) | EXPLICIT (workflow stages) | IMPLICIT | EXPLICIT (color badges) | **ENHANCE** |
| Next-step guidance | SUBTLE (tooltips) | EXPLICIT (workflow tab) | SUBTLE | NO | **ADD** |
| Primary action hierarchy | YES (visual prominence) | YES (workflow focus) | YES | PARTIAL | **ENHANCE** |

**Conclusion:** Photo Hub has good status visualization (better than Pixieset/ShootProof) but lacks state-based UI adaptation. Implementing P1 patterns brings it to industry standard with explicit status as differentiator.
